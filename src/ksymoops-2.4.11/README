ksymoops reads a Linux kernel Oops file and makes the best stab at
converting the code to instructions and mapping addresses to kernel
symbols.

Copyright 1999 Keith Owens <kaos@ocs.com.au>.
Released under the GNU Public Licence, Version 2.

This is a complete replacement for the version of ksymoops in the
kernel.  Older versions of ksymoops were in scripts/ksymoops.cc, more
recently there was a version in the scripts/ksymoops directory.  This
code has grown to the stage that it should be separated from the
kernel.

For full documentation, see the man page, ksymoops.8.

Please do *not* send oops reports to kaos@ocs.com.au unless you find
something wrong with ksymoops itself.  Oops reports should go to the
maintainer of the failing code or, if you do not known who maintains
the code, to an appropriate linux mailing list.
