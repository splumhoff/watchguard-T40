 * VMware deployment package header. 4 byte alignment assumed.
 * The header size is exactly 512 bytes to make it easier to
 * embed in a disk device, such as a partition.
 *
 * The payload is extracted and expanded into a temporary folder.
 * During expansion, original relative path names are preserved.
 * The specified command is then executed on the host.
 * Its working directory is the extraction folder.
 * The command string may contain OS-specific environment
 * variables.
 * In addition, the variable VMWAREPKGDIR is defined to be
 * the location of the extraction folder.
 *
 * (Request for comment: is VMWAREPKGDIR really necessary?
 *  Remove from spec if not.)
 *
 * The field seed is used by the password obfuscation library to hide details
 * that are required for obfuscating password in the config file.
 *
 * Command string example:
 * deploy.bat -opt1 myfile.exe foo.xml "%WINDIR%\system32"
 *
 * Seed is a piece of information used by the obfuscation code to compute
 * cryptography keys.
 *
 * The extraction folder is deleted after the command returns.
 * A return value of zero indicates successful deployment.
 *
 * Here is the approximate layout. Do not make assumptions about the 
 * exact location and relative position of the individual sections.
 * Use the offset and length fields from the header instead.
